* EEPROM
X	- Save float values into EEPROM
	- Fill EEPROM --> each time isTimeToSample returns true, we sample the ADC and then send the values into the EEPROM,
						updating logsToday, lastIndex
	- Valuate EEPROM usage (index of how many days we saved until last transfer * bytes per day / EEPROM size)
	- Save dayIndex and howManyDays into EEPROM!


* Thresholds behavior:
	- Pull high a pin for alarm th. --> Buzzer
		+ Display ALARM on LCD
	- Pull high a pin for on th. --> Air de-humidifier
		+ Display de-hum ON on LCD


* Serial interface:
	- First sending a single char from PC and displaying it on the LCD
	- Develop form application
	- Create CSV
	- List of commands:
		+ Save EEPROM content
		+ Check EEPROM usage					\
		+ How many days since last transfer		-\--> these two can be done automatically once opened serial port.
